# Welcome to the Solar System repository!

This was the first project I did using React Library on Trybe! 
Bellow in this readme you can read the project requirements, or check the site [here](https://sataniksystem.netlify.app/).

# In this project I was able to: 

  * Use JSX in React

  * Use the render() component

  * Use import and export to handle files

  * Create class components in React

  * Create multiple components from an Array

  * Use props

  * Use PropTypes in order to validate the props of a component

  * Keep my code clean using Lint rules

  * Use git to commit and push the project requirements

## What was developed in this project: 

In this project, I developed a model of the solar system. By using this interface the user would be able to: 

 * See all the solar system planets rendered in the screen;

 * See all the missions and information about them;

# Project requirements:
The following list are the requirements of this project, designed by Trybe.

## 1. Create a componenet called `Header`

- Create a componenet called `Header` inside the folder `src/components`.This componenet will render the main title of the page.

- For each planeta da list, you must render a component `PlanetCard`, giving the attribute `name` to a prop `planetName` and the attribute `image` to a prop `planetImage`.

## 7. Create a component called `Missions`.

- Create a component called `Missions` inside the folder `src/components`.
